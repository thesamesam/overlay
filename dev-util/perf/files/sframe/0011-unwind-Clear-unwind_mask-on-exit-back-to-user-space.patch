Subject: [PATCH 11/39] unwind: Clear unwind_mask on exit back to user space

When testing the deferred unwinder by attaching deferred user space
stacktraces to events, a live lock happened. This was when the deferred
unwinding was added to the irqs_disabled event, which happens after the
task_work callbacks are called and before the task goes back to user
space.

The event callback would be registered when irqs were disabled, the
task_work would trigger, call the callback for this work and clear the
work's bit. Then before getting back to user space, irqs would be disabled
again, the event triggered again, and a new task_work registered. This
caused an infinite loop and the system hung.

To prevent this, clear the bits at the very last moment before going back
to user space and when instrumentation is disabled. That is in
unwind_exit_to_user_mode().

Move the pending bit from a value on the task_struct to the most
significant bit of the unwind_mask (saves space on the task_struct). This
will allow modifying the pending bit along with the work bits atomically.

Instead of clearing a work's bit after its callback is called, it is
delayed until exit. If the work is requested again, the task_work is not
queued again and the work will be notified that the task has already been
called (via UNWIND_ALREADY_EXECUTED return value).

The pending bit is cleared before calling the callback functions but the
current work bits remain. If one of the called works registers again, it
will not trigger a task_work if its bit is still present in the task's
unwind_mask.

If a new work registers, then it will set both the pending bit and its own
bit but clear the other work bits so that their callbacks do not get
called again.
